		   <p class="mainbodygreysmall">When AEGON UK decided to review its long-standing relationship with a leading print management provider, its primary objective was to select an organisation that was capable of delivering innovative, cost effective print solutions with standards of service and product quality radically better than it had been receiving. </p>
		   <p class="mainbodygreysmall">According to Jayne Ponzio, Head of communications/Sponsorship and Marketing Services, the <b>aps</b> Group proposal was not only innovative and forward looking but it was a compelling proposition that would provide AEGON UK users with an exciting opportunity to benefit from a new approach to work.</p>
		   <p class="mainbodygreysmall">AEGON  UK, part of the Dutch owned AEGON Group, and one of the world’s largest life insurance and pensions providers, undertook a tender exercise for the services being supplied by its current print management company; that of print, storage and distribution.</p>
		   <p class="mainbodygreysmall">Jayne takes up the story:  “Following an exhaustive process we decided to sever our long-standing print management relationship and invited APS Group to work with us in support of our specific objectives which were to:</p>
		  
           
		     
		      <p class="mainbodylists">Introduce processes improvements for print, document production, order processing, storage, distribution and fulfilment</p>
		      <p class="mainbodylists"> Deliver substantial savings across the total print spend</p>
		       <p class="mainbodylists"> Provide brand marketing support at the highest level</p>
               
               <p><img src="images/montage.jpg" alt="AEGON montage" width="518" height="421" /></p>
	        
       <p class="mainbodygreysmall"> APS project team undertook a full review of Aegon’s existing systems and processes submitting proposals for a model that was much wider than just providing print, storage and distribution. It was a business solution that centred on a full, electronic end-to-end document management process and involved the outsourcing to APS of an internal design, artwork and production studio.</p>
		   <p class="mainbodygreysmall">The solutions recommended presented a radical change for AEGON UK including the introduction of SimplyInfo, a web-based management system unique to APS that would result in a whole new way of working for AEGON staff.
The traditional job bag system with all its requests for compliance, technical and legal checks as well as creative, artwork and print quotes being supplied in hard copy format would become redundant.
It would be replaced with a fully electronic document management system providing detailed information available at the click of a mouse.</p>
		
		    <p class="mainbodygreysmall"> AEGON UK was also attracted to two other distinctive features contained in the APS proposal:</p>
		    <p class="mainbodylists">A fixed price calculator for the majority of its print jobs providing long-term price stability</p>
		     <p class="mainbodylists">Hi-tech access to management information and online tools, designed in conjunction with AEGON&rsquo;s communication management team, to help staff keep track of jobs as well as manage budgets, timescales and quality</p>
             
		     <p class="mainbodygreysmall">A phased implementation of the services  followed in order to minimise any risk to AEGON UK’s business.
A seamless operation for the transferral of existing stock belonging to AEGON to APS's own warehousing facilities was undertaken with individual items of stock being counted, re-packed and re-labelled before being placed in storage.</p> 
<p class="mainbodygreysmall">These stock items along with desktop stationery items are available for delivery to AEGON staff throughout the UK using the APS SimplyOrder system. 
  <br />
  As the services have progressed and become established, feedback from users is very positive with ringing endorsement for SimplyInfo which people consider ‘an excellent tool’.
  <br />
  Commenting on the new system, Jayne says, “We were aware that our existing trafficking process, with paper copies and job bags, was too slow and inefficient and lacked the controls we needed. 
  <br />
  “SimplyInfo offers us a content management tool that has substantially improved our work flow. The partnership between AEGON UK and APS Group has already delivered significant cost savings, process enhancements and service improvements and we will  continue to work closely with APS Group to consider further opportunities for improvement and innovation.”</p>
